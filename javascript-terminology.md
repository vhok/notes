What the **rumpelstiltskin principle** has taught us is that to be able to name something empowers you over that which is being named. In modern terms, "name it to tame it". I noticed that it was easier for me to memorize the terms through understanding the *differences* between them. It had the added benefit of creating an association between related terms rather than rotely memorizing a definition. Therefore, you won't see me writing this document in a glossary style way.
## Expressions vs. Statements
A **statement** is an instruction that is executed by a program, whereas, an **expression** is a piece of code that produces a value.
## Callback Function vs. Function Definition
The use of the term **callback** function refers to the context to which a function definition is applied. Callback refers to when a function definition or the *value* of the function is passed as an argument.
