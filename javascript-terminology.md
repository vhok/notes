What the rumpelstiltskin principle has taught us is that to name something empowers you. But, to truly understand is to know the nuances.
## Expressions vs. Statements
A **statement** is an instruction that is executed by a program, whereas, an **expression** is a piece of code that produces a value.
## Callback Function vs. Function Definition
The use of the term **callback** function refers to the context to which a function definition is applied. Callback refers to when a function definition or the *value* of the function is passed as an argument.
