What the rumpelstiltskin principle has taught us is that to be able to name something empowers you over that which is being named. In modern terms, "name it to tame it". But, I felt it was easier to learn by understanding the nuances. Therefore, I decidede to take less of a glossary style approach to understand JavaScript concepts.
## Expressions vs. Statements
A **statement** is an instruction that is executed by a program, whereas, an **expression** is a piece of code that produces a value.
## Callback Function vs. Function Definition
The use of the term **callback** function refers to the context to which a function definition is applied. Callback refers to when a function definition or the *value* of the function is passed as an argument.
