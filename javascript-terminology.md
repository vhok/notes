# JavaScript Terminology
What the **rumpelstiltskin principle** has taught us is that to be able to name something empowers you over that which is being named. In modern terms, "name it to tame it".
## Expressions vs. Statements
A **statement** is an instruction that is executed by a program, whereas, an **expression** is a piece of code that produces a value.
## Callback Function vs. Function Definition
The use of the term **callback** function refers to the context to which a function definition is applied. Callback refers to when a function definition or the *value* of the function is passed as an argument.
## Primitive Type vs. Non-Primitive Type
A **primitive type** is an immutable value meaning it cannot be modify or changed. This is because they are the lowest common denominator that form the basis of other values. In JavaScript these values are wrapped by objects (with the exception of undefined and null). **non-primitive type** refers to everything that's not a primitive type, namely *objects*. When dealing with primitive types, such as the case in assigning variables, we deal with their values. However, when we deal with non-primitive types we deal with their address in memory.
## Statically Typed vs. Dynamically Typed
A **dynamically typed** programming language such as JavaScript has variables whose type *can* change during runtime. Whereas, a **statically typed** programming language is defined at development and not *supposed to*¹ change during runtime such as TypeScript.
